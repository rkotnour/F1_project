# Formula 1 Analysis

**Introduction**

Like many Americans I’ve become obsessed to Formula 1 racing, thanks to Netflix’s show F1 Drive to Survive. It’s a very stylish sport with a lot of over-the-top personalities, which makes for a lot of drama. But the show doesn’t give a very in-depth look at the sport’s history. My analysis focuses on the drivers, demographics such as their nationality and age, as well as an overall look at the constructors’ performance over the years. 

Formula 1 has been around for many decades. I wanted a broad overview of where the races are held and where the drivers are from. I also wanted to focus my analysis on which drivers and constructors have scored the most points and the most wins. Finally, I was also curious about the drivers and how they have seemingly gotten younger as the sport progresses. Are drivers actually getting younger, and are the young drivers better than older, more seasoned drivers? 

**My findings are as follows:**

- First, races are predominately held in Europe, with Italy hosting the most races. 

- Next, the British produce the most F1 drivers. American drivers are a close second. But the British drivers have scored the most points.

- Looking at constructors, Ferrari has won the most points as well as the most podiums. 

- Moving onto age, which ranges from 18 to 59, with the average age being 30. I grouped the age range into quartiles: 18-28, 29-38, 39-48, and 49-59. 

  - Drivers overwhelmingly compete while in the 18-38 age range. 
  - Drivers in this age range also score the most points
  - The average age for podium winners (top three finishers) is 30.78
  - The average age for race winners (first place) is 30.93
  - Drivers are getting younger as the sport progresses, with 27 being the current average driver age. In 1950, the first season, the average age of drivers was 36. 

**Conclusion**

Formula 1 appears to be a sport dominated by European drivers and European races, and Ferrari appears to be the most winning constructor. Drivers are trending younger, and these younger drivers are scoring the most points and winning the most podiums.  

However, it’s evident that the sport has evolved over time, and additional analysis may be warranted to reflect those changes. It would be interesting to examine if the points structure has changed, as that may yield different results for both constructors and drivers. It would also be interesting to examine drivers’ age over different periods of the sport. It’s evident that drivers have gotten younger over the years, but has it always been the case that younger drivers have performed better? Finally, it would be interesting to see if the top performing drivers have gotten better or worse as they age, and if there’s any correlation with driver performance and constructor performance.
